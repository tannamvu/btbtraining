    <h2>Challenging Conversations</h2>

        <h3>2 Day Course</h3>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 20px;">Overview</h4>

        <p>We have probably all been situations where we are trying to avoid talking to someone, as we feel uncomfortable about the forthcoming conversation, the outcomes and how we will feel about ourselves. These conversations, and these feelings, may arise for a number of reasons, but whatever the reason these difficult, or challenging, conversations should not be avoided.</p>
        <p>This training event will uncover why conversations can be seen as being difficult, and build strategies for dealing with them.  Not least will be the proposition that these conversations should be planned and prepared for, and the sessions covered in the course will provided the mechanisms that any such plan should execute.</p>
        <p>TThis practical course will be interactive, with many workshops, exercises, role plays and questionnaires. </p>
        <p>Descartes is quoted as saying ‘You cannot dissect me with a blunt instrument’; the questionnaires thatthe delegates will complete are not meant to pigeonhole them, but give them an insight into their modes of operation and how others might be affected.</p>
        <h4 style="margin-top: 20px;">Who will this course benefit?</h4>
        <p>
            This course will benefit any member of staff who might find certain conversations difficult; these might be difficult messages to be delivered to customers or colleagues, feedback to subordinates, or feedback to peers.
